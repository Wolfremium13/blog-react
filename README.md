# Wolfremium's Blog

This is Next.js 13 blog with TypeScript, MDX, Prettier, and Tailwind CSS.

## üñ• Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

## üìù Writing Posts

To write a new post, create a new `.mdx` file inside the `posts` directory. The
file name should be the slug of the post.

For example, to create a post with the slug `hello-world`, create a file called
`hello-world.mdx` inside the `posts` directory.

Inside the `.mdx` file, you can write your post using Markdown syntax. You can
also use HTML tags inside MDX.

## üß™ Testing

To run the unit tests with Jest, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

I also included Playwright for end-to-end testing. To run the end-to-end tests,
run the following command:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
